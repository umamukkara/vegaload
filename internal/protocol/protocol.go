// Package protocol defines the shared interface every wire protocol
// driver (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC, WebSocket, TCP, UDP) implements, plus the request
// and result types they exchange with the engine.
//
// This package, and the driver packages beneath it, are the only places
// in VegaLoad that know what HTTP, gRPC, or a WebSocket handshake actually
// look like on the wire. internal/engine calls a driver's Do method
// through this interface and otherwise knows nothing protocol-specific —
// see AGENTS.md's module boundaries.
