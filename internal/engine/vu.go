// Iterations still in flight when the run ends (ctx cancelled, or its
// deadline passed) are not
// recorded: a cancel/deadline error from cutting them off is not a real
// failure and must not inflate error counts.
//

// caller's job, typically by deriving ctx from context.WithTimeout at
// the executor level. A VU that never returns from iter will never
// stop; protocol implementations are expected to respect ctx.

// until it does. In that gap a driver sees the deadline at once and fails
// in microseconds, so a VU can record thousands of false failures before
// the cancel arrives. Checking the clock against the deadline closes the
// gap.
