# JSON report

`vegaload run -out report.json` writes a JSON summary of the run. `vegaload compare`, `-baseline` and `vegaload diagnose` read this file.

All times are whole numbers of nanoseconds. Names end in `_ns`. A rate such as `error_rate` is a fraction: `0.02` is 2%.

Some sections appear only when they apply. This page was checked against real 0.9.0 files.

## Top level

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `executor` | The load shape, such as `fixed-vus`. |
| `started_at` | When the run started, as a UTC timestamp. |
| `elapsed_ns` | How long the run took. |
| `total` | Number of iterations or calls counted. |
| `failed` | How many of them failed. |
| `error_rate` | `failed` divided by `total`. |
| `latency` | The latency summary. See below. |
| `time_series` | The run, cut into slices over time. |
| `thresholds` | Each threshold and its result. Present when you set thresholds. |
| `thresholds_passed` | `true` if every threshold passed. |
| `baseline` | The result of the baseline gate. Present with `-baseline`. |
| `steps` | Results for each named `step()`. Present when the scenario uses steps. |
| `protocols` | Results for each protocol the run used. |
| `checks` | Pass and fail counts for each check. Present when the scenario uses checks. |

## `latency`

The same fields appear in `steps` and `protocols`.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `min_ns`, `mean_ns`, `max_ns` | Fastest, average and slowest call. |
| `p50_ns`, `p90_ns`, `p95_ns`, `p99_ns` | Percentiles. `p95_ns` means 95% of calls were this fast or faster. |

## `time_series[]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `offset_ns` | Where this slice starts, counted from the start of the run. |
| `requests` | Calls in this slice. |
| `failed` | Failed calls in this slice. |
| `rps` | Calls per second in this slice. |
| `error_rate` | Failure fraction in this slice. |

## `thresholds[]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The threshold as you wrote it. |
| `metric` | The metric, such as `p95`. |
| `operator` | The comparison, such as `<`. |
| `value` | The limit, as text, such as `500ms`. |
| `observed` | What the run measured, as text. |
| `passed` | `true` or `false`. |
| `step` | The step the threshold is limited to. Present only for a step threshold. |
| `protocol` | The protocol the threshold is limited to. Present only for a protocol threshold. |

## `baseline`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The baseline file you gave. |
| `max_regression_percent` | The slack you allowed. |
| `passed` | `true` if no metric regressed beyond the slack. |
| `metrics[]` | One entry for `error_rate` and one for `latency.p95`. Each has `name`, `baseline`, `candidate`, `unit` and `regressed`. |
| `notes[]` | A plain sentence about the result. |

## `steps[]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The step name. |
| `total` | How many times the step ran. |
| `failed` | How many runs failed. |
| `error_rate` | The failure fraction. |
| `latency` | The latency summary. |

## `protocols[]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The protocol, such as `http`. |
| `total`, `failed`, `error_rate` | Counts and failure fraction for this protocol. |
| `latency` | The latency summary. |
| `bytes_sent`, `bytes_received` | Bytes moved. |
| `bytes_per_second` | Throughput. |
| `operations[]` | One entry per kind of call, such as `GET`. Each has `name`, `total`, `failed`, `error_rate`, `latency`, `bytes_sent` and `bytes_received`. |

## `checks[]`

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | The check name. |
| `passes` | How many times it passed. |
| `fails` | How many times it failed. |

## Example

A short run with one step and one check, trimmed:

```json
{
  "executor": "fixed-vus",
  "total": 224,
  "failed": 0,
  "error_rate": 0,
  "latency": { "p50_ns": 26642194, "p95_ns": 40212388 },
  "thresholds": [
    { "name": "p95 < 500ms", "metric": "p95", "operator": "<",
      "value": "500ms", "observed": "40.22ms", "passed": true }
  ],
  "thresholds_passed": true,
  "steps": [{ "name": "list", "total": 224, "failed": 0 }],
  "checks": [{ "name": "status is 200", "passes": 224, "fails": 0 }]
}
```
