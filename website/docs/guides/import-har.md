# Start from a browser recording

Record a real session in your browser (the network tab can save it as a
HAR file), then turn it into a scenario:

```
vegaload import har recording.har -o checkout.vl.js
vegaload validate -secret-env VL_COOKIE checkout.vl.js
```

The importer makes a first draft, and you edit it. It keeps the real calls,
in the order they were recorded, one `http` call each, with a check on the
status the browser got. It leaves out images, fonts, style sheets and
scripts, requests to other sites (analytics, ads, CDNs), CORS preflight
requests, and requests that failed. "Other sites" means sites other than the
one of the first page you opened in the recording. Use `-include-static`,
`-include-third-party` or `-host` to change that, and `-max N` to stop after
N requests.

The importer keeps the secrets it can recognise out of the file as
`env.VL_NAME`. You pass each one by name with `-secret-env`. That covers a
password, an API key, a session id, and any header, query parameter or body
field whose name looks secret. A `Cookie` or `Authorization` header is a
secret when an earlier response on the same host did not set that cookie or
return that bearer token. A CSRF token or a view state is not a secret: the
notes below say when the scenario reads it from a response. A value with an
ordinary name stays as it was recorded, including a token in a path such as
`/reset/<token>`, a query parameter named `code`, or a field named `key`.
Read the file before you share it, and do not commit the HAR file. The
importer also drops headers a client sets by itself (`User-Agent`,
`Content-Length`, `Referer`, `Origin`, `Sec-*` and similar).

Some things are left for you, and the file marks them with `TODO` lines:

- A value that looks like it changes on every run (a UUID, a long number, a
  token), when the nearest earlier response on the same host does not hold
  it in a named place. When it does, the scenario reads it from that
  response: a JSON field, then a response header, then a `Set-Cookie`, then
  an input found by `name` or `id`. Two places of the same kind, including
  two JSON fields, stay in the file with a `TODO`, and an older response is
  not used. A password or an API key stays in the environment even if a
  response echoes it. A CSRF token or a view state is carried when the page
  returned it, and stays in the file with a `TODO` when it did not.
- A multipart body. It is left out.
- Waits between requests. A scenario has no sleep and no cookie jar. A
  cookie an earlier response set is carried. Any other cookie is a secret.
  In a script, `Set-Cookie` is every cookie the response set, separated by
  newlines, so a date in `Expires` stays intact.

The hosts in the file are real. A host that is not localhost needs
`-allow-target` on the run, and the file's first lines say which.
