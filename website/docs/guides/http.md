# Test an HTTP API

VegaLoad speaks HTTP/1.1 (`-protocol http1`) and HTTP/2 (`-protocol http2`). Both take `http://` and `https://` targets.

The examples on this page run against the [sample app](https://github.com/vegaload/vegaload/tree/main/examples/sample-app) in the repository. Start it first, in its own terminal:

```bash
cd examples/sample-app
go run .
```

It serves `http://127.0.0.1:8080` with `GET /health`, `GET /widgets`, `GET /widgets/{id}` and `POST /widgets`. Localhost is always allowed. For any other host, see [Safety](/ai-agents/safety).

## One command, no file

Read an endpoint with 5 users for 10 seconds:

```bash
vegaload run -target http://127.0.0.1:8080/widgets -protocol http1 -vus 5 -duration 10s
```

On a laptop this makes about 600 requests in 3 seconds, with p50 near 25 ms. The sample app adds 10 to 40 ms of delay on purpose.

Send a write with a method, a header and a body:

```bash
vegaload run -target http://127.0.0.1:8080/widgets -protocol http1 \
  -method POST -header 'Content-Type: application/json' -body '{"name":"bolt"}' \
  -vus 5 -duration 3s -out post.json
vegaload diagnose post.json
```

The sample app fails about 3% of creates on purpose. The run shows a failure rate near 3%, and `diagnose` says so.

| Flag | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `-method` | The HTTP verb. The default is GET. |
| `-header "Key: Value"` | A request header. Repeat it for more. |
| `-body` | The request body. |
| `-timeout` | The limit for one iteration. The default is 30 seconds. |
| `-insecure` | Skip the TLS certificate check. |
| `-data` | Fill `{data.NAME.COLUMN}` in `-body` from a CSV or JSON file. See [Data files](/guides/data-files). |

## HTTP/2

Use `-protocol http2`:

```bash
vegaload run -target http://127.0.0.1:8080/widgets -protocol http2 -vus 5 -duration 3s
```

The sample app serves HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 on one port, with the same handlers. A run with `http1` and a run with `http2` compare like for like. Any gap is protocol overhead. `-method POST` works here too.

## TLS

For `https://` targets, VegaLoad checks the certificate. To trust your own CA, or to send a client certificate, pass `ca_file`, `cert_file`, `key_file` and `tls_server_name` with `-opt`. See [TLS with your own CA](/guides/tls).

## Pass or fail limits

Add a threshold to stop a pull request when the API is too slow:

```bash
vegaload run -target http://127.0.0.1:8080/widgets -protocol http1 \
  -vus 5 -duration 3s \
  -threshold 'p95{protocol="http1"} < 300ms' -threshold 'error_rate < 1%'
```

A breach exits with code 3. See [Thresholds](/guides/thresholds).

## A flow of calls

One URL is not a user session. For a flow, such as create, read back and list, write a scenario. The script has `http.get`, `http.post`, `http.put`, `http.patch`, `http.delete` and `http.request`. A value from one call can go into the next.

[`crud-flow.vl.js`](https://github.com/vegaload/vegaload/blob/main/examples/scenarios/crud-flow.vl.js) (and its Python twin, [`crud_flow.py`](https://github.com/vegaload/vegaload/blob/main/examples/scenarios/crud_flow.py)) creates a widget, reads it back by id, and lists all widgets. Each stage is a named `step()`, so the report shows latency and errors for each one. Run it:

```bash
vegaload run -vus 5 -duration 10s crud-flow.vl.js
```

Flags go before the scenario file. See [Scenarios](/guides/scenarios) for the full script reference.

## Start from what you have

- From an OpenAPI file: `vegaload new -from-openapi openapi.json`. See the [cookbook recipe](/cookbook/start-from-an-openapi-spec).
- From a browser recording: `vegaload import har`. See [Start from a browser recording](/guides/import-har).

## Options

`vegaload protocols http1` lists the options for the protocol, and the scenario calls it has. HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 take `ca_file`, `cert_file`, `key_file` and `tls_server_name`. They write nothing to the server beyond what your requests send.
